# Application 2: Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates

## Overview
The **Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring** application captures and processes weather data streams in real time. It performs rollups and aggregates to provide summarized insights on temperature, humidity, and other key metrics.

## Design Choices
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Utilizes streaming technologies to capture weather data in real time.
- **Rollups and Aggregates**: Implements rollup and aggregation strategies to summarize data over specified time intervals, providing quick insights.
- **Modular Design**: The application is structured in a modular way, making it easy to extend or modify components.

## Application Structure



## Dependencies
To set up and run the application, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- Required libraries for handling streaming data (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.)

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy

##Running the Application
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/mrjaydeep/weather_monitoring.git
cd weather_monitoring

##Run the main script:
python play.py

#To run the unit tests, execute the following command:
python -m unittest test.py
